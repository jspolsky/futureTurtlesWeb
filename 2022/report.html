					<h3>We went home!</h3>

					<p>For the 36 turtles who came to Black Rock City this year, it was an incredible year.</p>

					<p>The conditions were… hard. Burning Man is always hard, but this year was worse than usual. The
						weather was hotter. There were more dust storms and whiteouts, which always seemed to be at the
						least convenient times (the build team put up most of the camp in super windy whiteout
						conditions). The things that we depend on the Burning Man organization to get right (roads, ice,
						fuel, gate and exodus) … were not right.</p>

					<p>As a camp, we had doubled in size, and a majority of us (24) had never been to Burning Man
						before. We were way more ambitious in terms of the camp we built, the interactive programs we
						put on, the quality of the food we made, and a lot more.</p>

					<p>There was a ton of work, but we were ready for it, and we got it all done. Everybody pitched in,
						even the sparkly newbies, so, thank you, sparkly newbies.</p>

							<h3>Advance Work</h3>

							<p>One of the things that made Burning Man easy this year was a large amount of work that
								was done
								in advance to get ready. We had two work weekends in Reno getting all our gear cleaned,
								sorted,
								and ready to go. Our San Francisco turtles built a beautiful wood bar and DJ booth that
								will
								serve us for years to come.</p>

							<h3>Early Build Week</h3>


							<p>The early build team converged in Reno a full week before the start of the event. We
								loaded
								trucks and unboxed new gear, and bought a lot of supplies, before heading to playa and
								arriving
								at a city that was still mostly empty. We could see the Man from our tents because the
								entire
								area from Esplanade to D was unbuilt.</p>

							<p>For the first night, our priority was just to build our own tents so we had a place to
								sleep.
								Unfortunately, at about 2am, a major wind storm swept through our little camp. We had
								built a
								minimal shade structure without side tarps, which became something of a sail in the
								wind.
								Unprotected by tarps, the Shiftpods started to blow away.&nbsp;</p>

							<p>After a few minutes we realized that we had to wake up, find masks and goggles, and
								rebuild the
								entire camp, in the midst of an incredible windstorm and whiteout conditions, and make
								it much
								stronger so we could go to sleep again. Which is what we did.</p>

							<p>The whiteout and windy conditions continued for much of build week. There were some
								breaks, but
								most of the week was incredibly difficult. Try to imagine spreading out a 14 x 48 canvas
								tarp on
								the ground in 20mph winds and getting it nailed down to the playa smoothly… now do that
								six
								times.</p>

							<p>By the third evening on playa we had assembled enough infrastructure to shower off (with
								a garden
								hose and kiddie pool), finally, which was probably the highlight of build week. Even
								though we
								got dusty again 20 seconds later, it was nice to get clean for a minute.</p>

							<h3>Late Build Week</h3>

							<p>Deliveries started arriving at our camp site: a big generator shared with Gender Blender
								and
								8-bit Bunny, the two trailers with all our gear, an insane amount of produce which we
								stuffed
								into our limited refrigerators, ten cases of corn on the cob we never ordered, a big
								tank of
								water that we used up in two days, a big empty tank for grey water, and two
								porto-potties. The
								camp started to take shape.</p>

							<p>Meanwhile more turtles were arriving in Reno trying to gather up and pack the rest of the
								gear we
								needed: huge amounts of food and groceries, an insane amount of liquor, an annoying
								trailer with
								three dozen bicycles, and every other little thing that could not be obtained on playa.
							</p>

							<h3>Arrivals</h3>

							<p>Most turtles take the Burner Bus Express… we love this because you don’t have to wait in
								huge
								lines to enter and exit the event. People trickled in on Saturday, Sunday, and as late
								as
								Monday, but everyone made it in time for our big kick-off party Monday night.</p>

							<p>Our location, in the middle of a block, did not have much traffic walking by, so our
								events were
								for the most part attended by neighbors who noticed our incredible DJs and our
								attractive camp,
								or people who had heard about the legendary turtles and who came to see what everyone
								was
								talking about.</p>

							<h3>Desert HiiT Workouts</h3>

							<p> It seems unlikely when the temperatures are in the upper 90s, but we had plenty of
								takers for
								our daily 11:00am high intensity interval training workouts. We took this a lot more
								seriously
								than some of you may remember from 2019. All the exercises were done in pairs which
								added a nice
								social
								element. People got a real workout, and a lot of them kept coming back throughout the
								week; on
								some days our space was at capacity.</p>

							<h3>A real music program</h3>
							<p>With two great resident DJs, several guest DJs, and even a couple of newbies learning the
								ropes,
								we always had great music. Our sound system with six big speakers
								sounded <strong>amazing</strong> in the clear desert air.</p>

							<p>It’s always hard to find and play the kind of music that everyone likes, but our DJs did
								it. I
								was pretty astonished to have multiple people come up to me and say that they love,
								love,
								loved&nbsp;<strong>all</strong>&nbsp;the music … including several people whose musical
								tastes I
								know to be completely non-overlapping.</p>

							<p>We had a very specific vibe in mind at the Future Turtles: cheerful, progressive, melodic
								house,
								one strict rule (“no pop!”) and the intent that you should never hear anything that
								you’ve heard
								in the real world before—the idea was that you should never hear a “song” that you
								recognized
								that reminded you of the default world, because Burning Man is most powerful when you
								can get
								absorbed in the alien world and never get yanked back to the default.</p>

							<h3>Great Food</h3>

							<p>With so many burners subsisting on granola bars and gifted pickles, we actually got a
								huge
								delivery of fresh produce and produced two amazing, nutritious hot meals a day, with
								options for
								vegans and unlimited snacks available 24/7. Our team of designated chefs (with the
								assistance of
								literally everyone, who did one or two kitchen shifts) produced food that was
								consistently
								healthy and tasty and really kind of astonishing given the conditions in which it was
								produced.
							</p>

							<h3>Bar</h3>
							<p>We had an organized bar with a full drinks program including premixed alcoholic and
								non-alcoholic
								cocktails every evening. We were surprised to find how popular the non-alcoholic options
								were. 
							</p>

							<p>Everything was super tasty. We even had everything we needed to make custom drinks for
								people (if
								we liked them enough, of course). Another huge highlight of the drinks program was
								Jorge’s cold
								brew coffee every morning.</p>

							<h3>Oh man, that Pillow Fort</h3>
							<p>Thanks the creative design of Oscar with tons of help from Andre and other turtles, we
								created
								what was probably the most magical space on the entire playa, a quiet, soft,
								air-conditioned
								underwater aquarium space that was dedicated to naps during the day (to catch up on
								sleep) and
								adult activities during the night. With magical dayglo decorations, Arduino-controlled
								black
								light animations creating a “wave” effect, magical music and even a scent program, the
								pillow
								fort was truly a spectacular new feature of the camp.</p>

							<h3>I've been talking about a lot of stuff. Burning Man is about the people.</h3>
							<p>To be honest it’s easy to get wrapped up in describing our infrastructure, but the whole
								camp
								would have sucked if we didn’t have such great people. And there’s no way to sum up the
								life-transforming experiences of 36 lovely turtles—heck, there’s no way even to convey
								the
								insane experiences we all had.</p>

							<p>We saw a glimpse of the greatest work of collaborative art ever created in the history of
								mankind, an artwork created in the audacious medium of a civilization, cooperatively
								created by
								70,000 untrained artists.</p>

							<p>We danced, and we slept through dances.</p>

							<p>We explored, and we missed 95% of what there was to find.</p>

							<p>We faffed, but we got there.</p>

							<p>We learned how much more we are capable of than we thought, and we also learned how to
								ask our
								neighbors for help.</p>

							<p>We fucked up massively, but we always got our shit together.</p>

							<p>We were together. We had moments of insanely painful loneliness.</p>

							<p>We apologized for past mistakes, and made new ones.</p>

							<p>We felt the greatest joy we had ever felt, but also cried our hearts out.</p>

							<p>We found love, and lost love.</p>

							<p>We were transformed.</p>
