Each tent is a ShiftPod 2, hexagonal shaped, just high enough to stand in and with room for two people. In the foreground, a shirtless man is unzipping the door to a tent. There are several hammocks and other camping furniture strewn around. The ground is dirt. The sun is extremely strong but the shade keeps most of it out."></span>

					<h3>So, you're thinking about camping with the Turtles?</h3>

					<p>The Future Turtles are a welcoming group of friends that spend time
						together during the year and at Burning Man.
					</p>
					<p>
						We love you! Hereâ€™s a little guide we put together to help you decide if you should camp with
						us.</p>

					<div class="row">
						<div class="col-6 col-12-small">


							<h3>Culture</h3>

							<dl>
								<dt>Weâ€™re pretty nerdy.
								</dt>
								<dd>
									<p>
										We are, to a large extent, nerds, engineers, programmers, gaymers, creators and
										artists,
										scientists and philosophers. A lot of us know our way around Python, LED
										circuits,
										computer science, and Monty Python. Debates about tabs vs. spaces turn us on.
									</p>
								</dd>

								<dt>We are a male gay camp.</dt>
								<dd>
									<p>Everyone is welcome, but we work actively to create a safe gay haven in a
										heteronormative world.</p>
								</dd>

								<dt>We're burners.</dt>
								<dd>
									<p>We try very hard <em>not</em> to be one of those camps that hosts parties at
										Burning
										Man
										that are indistinguishable from parties in San Francisco. Time on playa is too
										short
										to waste it by sipping vodka sodas, bopping slowly to some pop diva disco music,
										and
										getting judgy looks from tall men with perfect abs.</p>
									</p>
									<p>
										We <em>are</em> at Burning Man to get lost in dust storms, to jury-rig elaborate
										outdoor
										social showers, to fall asleep in a geodesic dome while somebody explains
										how to
										manifest aligned consciousness, to watch frat boys swinging from trapezes
										while
										removing their own shorts, and to chase sharks across the desert in a
										whaling ship.</p>
								</dd>

							</dl>

							<h3>Values</h3>

							<p>We share a lot of values. If you share them too, you'll fit right in!</p>

							<dl>
								<dt>No spectators.</dt>
								<dd>
									<p>
										Participation is key to being a Turtle. Burning Man is a temporary city, not a
										music festival. The best experiences come from participating in the civic life
										of that city, not from watching things other people are doing. We put on
										multiple events during the week and put a lot of emphasis on active
										participation in the city.
									</p>
								</dd>

								<dt>Everybody works.</dt>
								<dd>
									<p>
										Camping for a week in the harsh Black Rock Desert is tough. We try to make it
										easier by collaborating to build a beautiful camp, organizing delicious shared
										meals together, and providing communal gifts to the Burning Man community.
									</p>
									<p>
										The magic of Burning Man is the collaboration. Not only will you be
										collaborating to build something really awesome that you can be proud of, but
										you will test your own limits, learn many new skills, and make incredible
										friends for life. Burning Man is a transformative experience and the people you
										go through it with make all the difference.
									</p>
									<p>
										This all takes a ton of work, both in the months leading up to the event getting
										everything ready, and during the week of Burning Man itself. To camp with us,
										you can expect to put in several days of work before you even get to the event,
										and several hours of shifts every day once weâ€™re there.
									</p>
									<p>
										If that sounds like too much, thatâ€™s fine! Maybe you would like to go on a
										cruise ship? You will not have to work there at all.
									</p>
								</dd>

								<dt>Sliding scale for camp fees.</dt>
								<dd>
									<p>
										If we charged everyone equally for what it actually costs
										to run the camp, the Future Turtles would rapidly turn into
										a playground for the rich. That is not something we want to see.
										That's why we operate on an income-based dues system.
										Camp contributions range from $200 - $1000 (and up) based on your salary.
									</p>
									<p>
										We also have a NOTAFLOF (No One Turned Away For Lack Of Funds) policy.
										If you are in a situation where attending Burning Man would
										create financial hardship, and you apply for
										<a href="https://tickets.burningman.org/ticket-aid-program-2023/">Burning Man's
											Ticket Aid program</a>, your Future Turtles camp
										dues will be $10.
									</p>
								</dd>

								<dt>No drama.</dt>
								<dd>
									<p>Burning Man is very hard and most people, at some point, have some major
										emotional moments. Usually a pickle and a nap will fix you right up. If that
										doesnâ€™t, we have a team of volunteers called the Future Turtles Guardians to
										help. That said, behavior which creates unnecessary conflict or drama will
										detract from other peoplesâ€™ experience on playa and won't be tolerated.</p>
								</dd>

							</dl>

							<h3>Gifting</h3>
							<p>
								On playa, we aim to create a gorgeous and comfortable hangout for ourselves, our
								friends, and anyone who visits. Some of the gifts we offer the playa include:
							</p>
							<ul>
								<li>A bar serving alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks</li>
								<li>Sunset parties</li>
								<li>A morning Desert HiiT (High Intensity Interval Training) workout. With smoothies!
								</li>
								<li>Multiple spaces for lounging, cuddle puddles, and intimate encounters ðŸ˜ˆ</li>
							</ul>
							<p>
								If providing these gifts to people sounds like your kind of thing, for example,
								as a mixologist, DJ, fitness instructor, smoothie bar person, or just a greeter
								or facilitator for any of the above, you're in the right place.
							</p>

							<h3>Your Contribution</h3>
							<p>Turtles always dive in and do any work that needs to be done. If they see another turtle
								cleaning something, fixing something, or setting something up, they immediately go over
								and start helping without asking or being asked.</p>

							<p>Every turtle will be expected to make a significant work contribution of some sort before
								or after the burn. Typical ways that Turtles fulfill this responsibility:</p>

							<ol>
								<li>Participate in a work weekend in Reno, NV in the spring to help prepare our gear
								</li>
								<li>Join the early build team, arriving on playa a week before everyone else to build
									the camp</li>
								<li>Join the post-strike team, helping put away gear in Reno after the event</li>
								<li>As a part of the food and beverages team, preparing food and the food truck in Reno
									before the burn</li>
								<li>Meaningfully contribute to a camp art project and/or bring your own form of art</li>
							</ol>

							<p>In addition to those off-playa work opportunities, your obligations on playa include:</p>
							<ol>
								<li>Arriving no later than Monday of the event week</li>
								<li>Doing assigned work shifts including LNT (cleaning), kitchen shifts, ice runs,
									greetings and crowd control at events, which may add up to 12-18 hours total during
									the
									week</li>
								<li>Being on playa and participating in Camp Strike from 9am Sunday morning (the morning
									after Man Burn) until the camp is fully packed and the site has been raked and
									restored,
									which is usually noon Monday</li>
							</ol>
							<p>Finally, you canâ€™t camp with the Turtles unless:</p>
							<ol>
								<li>You have camped with us before and are a camper in good standing, OR you are
									sponsored by an existing camper with the approval of camp leadership.</li>
								<li>You subscribe to our email
									newsletter (there is a form at the bottom of this page),
									read it promptly, and always do all the things that it tells you to do.</li>
							</ol>
							<div class="box">
								<p>
									I know. Your inbox is a mess and you lose things in
									there. You are very busy
									and the
									burn is a long time away. But trust the process. Set up a filter to mark our
									newsletter as important. When a newsletter is released, drink some coffee and
									Ritalin, then make a point of reading it and responding right away. Otherwise
									you
									may miss some crucial deadline that is non-optional and youâ€™ll find it
									impossible to
									camp with us.
								</p>
							</div>

							<h3>What we provide collectively</h3>
							<p>Under the principle of Radical Self Reliance, every burner is responsible for providing
								for all their needs to stay alive in a remote desert lake bed for a week. The Future
								Turtles collaborates on some of these survival needs, bringing and building them
								together each year.</p>

							<ul>
								<li>Large shade structures</li>
								<li>Generator</li>
								<li>Field kitchen, where we serve two hot meals daily, with vegan options of course!
								</li>
								<li>Drinking water</li>
								<li>Grey water removal</li>
								<li>Barebones, outdoor cold showers, featuring hot nekkid boys like you</li>
							</ul>

							<p>We usually work to coordinate:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Rental bicycles, which are crucial to getting around the city</li>
								<li>Tents&mdash;we own some slick Shiftpods which you can rent, along with cots</li>
							</ul>
							<p>As we get closer to the burn, we'll provide more details on exactly what you have to
								prepare and bring, and we'll recruit volunteers to work on the things that we are going
								to bring collectively.
							</p>
							<h3>
								A couple more things...
							</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>Donâ€™t bring a vehicle, RV, or truck unless you are a part of the build team and it
									is required for that purpose. We donâ€™t have room for them in camp. <strong>Most
										Turtles take
										the Burner Express Bus</strong> and boy is that a great idea, since you avoid
									huge huge lines
									getting into and out of the city. (In 2022 the bus saved Turtles 6 hours in line to
									enter and 12 hours in line to exit).</li>
								<li>Assume that you will be offline without Internet access or cell service the whole
									time.</li>
								<li>Tickets to the event are very hard to get. We canâ€™t make any guarantees, but,
									historically, we have managed to find tickets for everyone who had been actively
									participating in preparation during the year. We will guide you through all the
									opportunities to buy tickets in the lead up to the event.</li>
							</ul>

							<h3>2025 Application Process</h3>
							<p>We deliberately keep the Future Turtles camp at about 40 people. Returning Turtles from
								the last two years have priority. We will open camp registration for Returning Turtles
								on March 1st.</p>

							<p>There will be room for some new Turtles, too. To join the camp as a new Turtle, you need
								to be sponsored by an existing Turtle who knows you well, will be on playa, and will
								commit to do your work shifts if you don't.</p>

							<p>The sponsorship form opens on June 1st. It will be filled out by your sponsor, not by the
								new turtle. A great way to find sponsors and to get a feel for if you are going to be a
								good fit for the camp would be to participate in our spring Reno Work Weekend,
								which is open to all. You should also attend as many in-person events in NY and SF as
								you can; they are monthly.</p>
							<p>We'll evaluate sponsored Turtles on a first-come, first-served basis. We can't guarantee
								that we will have room for everyone who is sponsored.</p>

							<p>Every year there are many people who camp in open camping or with other camps and still
								hang out socially with the Turtles on playa. All our events are open to the public, and
								we are happy to provide advice and logistical help to friends camping in open camping or
								at other camps, even if we don't have room for someone in our camp.</p>

							<h3>A couple of principles we take seriously</h3>
							<p> We value the transformative experience of sensual and consensual touch, play, and
								interaction. We believe that consent plays a vital part in our connectivity and
								community. Our vision is that all parties participate in a physical encounter from a
								place of enthusiasm and autonomy. Consent must be explicitly granted from an individual
								who is clearly in a state of mind to be able to grant it.</p>
							<p>Future Turtles center diversity, equity, and inclusion as core values of our community.
								Consent culture and safe places are key tenets of the Future Turtles, particularly for
								people of color, transgender, and non-binary persons.</p>
