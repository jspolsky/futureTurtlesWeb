						<h2>2024 AfterBurner Report</h2>
					</header>

					<p id="bkmrk-in-1990-a-small-cara">In 1990 a small caravan of cars containing members of the
						Cacophony Society, together with Larry Harvey, and a truck with a wooden man in it, pulled off
						of Nevada 447 into the desert. And when they hit the dry lake bed we call playa, they stopped
						and got out to look around. As Michael Mikel (Danger Ranger) told the story, "I took a stick,
						and I drew a line on the ground, and I had everybody line up. And I said, 'On the other side of
						this line, everything will be different. Reality itself will change.' We all stepped across that
						line together, and things&nbsp;<em>have</em> been different."</p>
					<p id="bkmrk-that-crossing-of-the">That crossing-of-the-line-in-the-desert theme has been a
						significant touchstone of the Burning Man experience since 1990. Many greeters use it to greet
						burgins as they arrive on playa. It speaks to how Burning Man is a great transformational
						experience, not just a festival, or an event, or a city.</p>
					<p id="bkmrk-"><a href="images/untitled-large.jpeg"><img src="images/untitled-large.jpeg"
								style="width:100%"></a></p>
					<p id="bkmrk-%C2%A0">Klajdi Tsano's untitled art piece on playa this year, the first placed art by
						any Turtle, was deliberately lit only from one side and as such immediately creates a line in
						the desert so that when you step through the piece, everything is different. The work, like all
						good Burning Man art, invites you to participate and to contemplate what crossing a line means
						to you. What were you before? What are you now? "By amplifying this simple act of cutting, the
						installation seeks to evoke a sense of the sublime and the uncanny, prompting visitors to
						reflect on their own place within the vast desert landscape," Klajdi wrote.<br></p>
					<h3 id="bkmrk-turtles-hit-their-st">Turtles hit their stride</h2>
						<p id="bkmrk-this-was%2C-by-all-acc">This was, by all accounts, an easy year to do Burning Man.
						</p>
						<p id="bkmrk-tickets-were-easy-to">Tickets were easy to get. The weather was great. Things just
							worked. Alot of the things we've been putting in place have finally all come together to
							make a
							camp that is a pleasure to be a part of.</p>
						<p id="bkmrk-i%27ve-been-having-a-l">I've been having a little bit of trouble getting started on
							this Afterburner report. We spend 8,832 hours on playa collectively, and I can capture only
							a
							fraction of that in this inadequate report.<br></p>
						<p id="bkmrk-oh%2C-did-i-mention%3F-w">Oh, did I mention? We're, like, <em>popular</em> now.
							Somehow
							everybody knows about the Turtles and comes to all our parties. And boy did we have some
							great
							ones!<br></p>
						<p id="bkmrk-doing-an-opening-nig">Doing an <strong>opening night party&nbsp;</strong>as soon as
							the
							gates open at midnight is a great idea. There is literally nothing else going on, and the
							entire
							queerborhood and everyone that had been busy building their camps showed up. It was great
							timing
							this year as the bus with most of our camp had literally pulled up just a few minutes before
							midnight.<br></p>
						<p id="bkmrk-the-monday-night%C2%A0kin">The Monday night&nbsp;<strong>kink
								party&nbsp;</strong>was
							probably the biggest hit of the week, not just for the Turtles, but for the entire
							neighborhood.
							It was a huge blowout signature party and many only-at-Burning-Man stories are still being
							told
							about that party.</p>
						<p id="bkmrk-our-thursday-night-m">Our Thursday night <strong>mud party</strong> was a throwback
							to
							last year's 18 hour epic mudpocalypse party, and featured mud wrestling, mud outfits, and
							general mud appreciation.&nbsp;</p>
						<p id="bkmrk-finally-on-saturday-">Finally on Saturday afternoon we hosted a great
							<strong>Wardrobe
								Malfunction</strong> party which was a nice way to close out the week.
						</p>
						<p id="bkmrk-all-of-our-parties-w">All of our parties were big neighborhood hits and I'm glad
							the
							queerborhood now knows us and sees us as a fun place to hangout. I really feel that with our
							corner location, our hub, and our reputation, we are now fully qualified as an anchor camp
							of
							the queerborhood... and the fact that we can do that with just 43 turtles is a testament to
							how
							great our camp is.</p>
						<h3 id="bkmrk-other-interactivity">Other interactivity</h2>
							<p id="bkmrk-shuai-taught-people-">Shuai taught people how to Shuffle, Jihoon did Tarot
								readings,
								and Tristan led two popular yoga sessions. Oh, and we apparently hosted a delightful
								tomahawk
								steak and crab dinner for some stupid camp down the road, and actually hosted extra
								parties that
								you probably didn't even notice with amazing guest DJs from nearby camps Gymnasium,
								Paradise
								Motel, GlamCocks and Dusty Frogz.<br></p>
							<p id="bkmrk-we-also-learned-that">We also learned that having a "24/7 play space" is not
								going to
								work unless you staff it 24/7. We did a quick course-correction and decided that can
								only be
								open to the public when there are a couple of turtles at the door getting people to
								enthusiastically commit to practice consent. After this correction, we decided the
								Pillow Fort
								would only be open to the public during our parties when it could be staffed and
								monitored.</p>
							<h3 id="bkmrk-food">Food</h2>
								<p id="bkmrk-one-day-in-2019-b.-r">We had some really insanely superb meals this year;
									probably the
									best food we've <em>ever</em> had on playa. I don't think any other camp eats as
									well as we do,
									not even the fancy plug-and-play camps with celebrity paid chefs. Kudos goes to
									Future Turtles
									MVP Benny Bergon who organized the whole thing, with along with celebrity chefs Jon,
									AlexSF,
									Christophe, MJ, AlexW, Spacemaster, Romain, Dimitri, Kevin, and Alejandro who blew
									us away twice
									a day.</p>
								<h3 id="bkmrk-a-working-camp">A working camp</h2>
									<p id="bkmrk-sometimes-you%27re-at-">Sometimes you're at a party where most of the
										attendees are
										standing around, taking a sip out of a can of White Claw, maybe then leaving the
										rest of the can
										perched on the edge of a table for the Can Fairy to clean up.&nbsp;</p>
									<p id="bkmrk-but-you-notice-that-">But you notice that there are a couple of people
										there who are
										running around doing things. They might be getting people drinks, throwing away
										trash, making
										guacamole in the kitchen, futzing with the playlist, or even just introducing
										newcomers and
										showing them where the hot tub is.</p>
									<p id="bkmrk-and-in-fact-those-ar">And in fact those are the people you want to be
										your friends.
										Because when you go on vacations with them, you're not going to be the only one
										cleaning up and
										you're not going to be the one at 5 pm worrying about where dinner is coming
										from and you're not
										going to live in a pile of trash and have to order pizza at 9:58pm from the last
										place open in
										town.<br></p>
									<p id="bkmrk-that%27s-the-principle">That's the principle of the Turtles. We
										surround ourselves by
										people who like to make things and do things and who take responsibility for
										everything they see
										around them. Through our Reno work weekends, everybody gets a chance to work on
										preparing the
										camp for another year. Our build team consists of ridiculously hard-working
										turtles that spend
										an extra four days in the Black Rock Desert preparing the camp for everyone's
										arrival. Members
										of the food team arrived a few days early in Nevada to get the food fort ready,
										filled with
										propane, repaired and fully stocked with food. Some turtles took it upon
										themselves to organize
										a truck from San Francisco to bring our stuff in and our trash out and then did
										the extra work
										to make spare space available for friends and neighbors. People contributed by
										designing and
										creating great parties, great lighting, camp signage, an electrical grid that
										works so well we
										just gift electricity to four neighboring camps, ice, ice water, drinks, snacks,
										a fresh water
										system and grey water pumping, organizing the Turtle Bus, creating our new kink
										space; they
										contributed by keeping the Gayflower sparkly clean and decorated with hilarious
										signage, by
										dealing with garbage and even composting this year, which had to
										be&nbsp;<em>dried out</em>, by
										keeping our fleet of bikes in good repair, by organizing the tool fort so we can
										find things, by
										setting up an incredible sound system and creating great DJ sets, by creating
										(and cleaning) the
										magical pillow fort and keeping it safe, by greeting people coming to our
										parties and getting
										their goddamn bikes off the street so the party doesn't get shut down, by
										manifesting the spirit
										of the mud party through mud wrestling, the wardrobe malfunction party through
										wardrobe
										malfunctions, and the kink party through... well, you've already heard about
										that. In fact what
										makes the Turtles work as such an amazing camp is the fact that so many turtles
										went so far
										above and beyond to make amazing things happen in camp.<br></p>
									<p id="bkmrk-this-is-not-the-camp">This is not the camp for everyone. A completely
										reasonable way to
										camp at Burning Man is to bring a tent and a cooler with some food and spend
										your whole burn
										outside of camp.&nbsp;Other people might prefer to camp with a slightly less
										manically
										industrious group of people, which is fine too.</p>
									<h3 id="bkmrk-%C2%A0-1">Camping and Art</h2>
										<p id="bkmrk-one-night-this-year%2C">One night this year, I found myself, for
											some reason, at another gay
											camp that was running a party of some sort, only the generator had
											gone off, so the
											party didn't even have music, which made the costumes people had brought for
											the party seem kind
											of strange and out of place. While everyone waited for "someone" to fix the
											generator and make
											the music start again, I was wondering what the heck I was doing there. So I
											left. And I blasted
											out on my bike to the nighttime playa, which, as you know by now, is the
											most incredible place
											on earth, something that doesn't exist anywhere else. Freedom, lights,
											childlike wonder, play,
											music, infinity, the best people on earth, house-sized unicorns shooting
											flames, lasers, stars,
											airplanes shooting lasers at the stars, for miles and miles and miles. Why
											the fuck is anyone
											standing around waiting for disco music to come
											back on in their
											camp.</p>
										<p id="bkmrk-so-now%C2%A0we-have-great">So now&nbsp;we have
											great&nbsp;<em>stuff</em> at the Future
											Turtles Theme Camp. We are a camp, which means we serve a residential
											function, a place to
											sleep, eat, wash, and get dressed. We are a part of the residential Black
											Rock City where we put
											on neighborhood block parties and other events to enrich Burning Man for our
											friends and
											neighbors. We have 43 incredibly charming turtles who you should make
											friends with if you are
											not already. So that's great.</p>
										<p id="bkmrk-but-now-that-we-have">But now that we have that all squared away,
											it's important to
											remember the part of Black Rock City that is not just a fancy campground.
											It's the playa. The
											playa at night. The playa during the day. Monumental art. Art you can climb.
											Art that drives
											around. The insane, otherworldly, nowhere-else-on-earth feeling of blasting
											out into playa at
											night and seeing the spectacle of 1000 interesting life-changing things you
											can go visit, all
											lit by LEDs and flames.</p>
										<p id="bkmrk-so.-the-future-turtl">The Future Turtles fifth adventure. In 2024,
											the line we crossed
											was Esplanade. Thanks to Klajdi's vision and hard work, and the willingness
											of other
											cheerful&nbsp;turtles to help him, we built art on the playa for the first
											time. The spell of
											Placement's urban planning was broken. We checked that box off our list,
											thoroughly and
											completely. It is time to stop fucking around by our tents and venture out
											to the pulsing heart
											of Burning Man.</p>
