						and preparations for our return are in full-swing.

						The best way
						to follow along is by hopping into our <a
							href="https://discord.com/invite/rpqSEVWy2Y">Discord</a>
						server and saying Hi!
					</p>
					<h3>Who we are</h3>
					<p>We are, mostly, happy mutants: nerds, engineers, programmers, gaymers, creators and artists,
						scientists and
						philosophers.
						A lot of us know our way around Python, Monty Python, LED circuits, and computer science.
						Debates about tabs vs.
						spaces turn us on.</p>
					<p>We are a male gay camp. Everyone is welcome, but we work actively to create a safe gay haven in a
						heteronormative world.</p>
					<p>We're burners.
						We try very hard <em>not</em> to be one of those camps that hosts parties at Burning Man that
						are
						indistinguishable from
						parties in San Francisco. Time on playa is too short to waste it by sipping vodka sodas, bopping
						slowly to some pop
						diva
						disco music, and getting judgy looks from tall men with perfect abs.
						We <em>are</em> at Burning Man to get lost in dust storms, to jury-rig elaborate outdoor social
						showers, to
						fall asleep in
						a
						geodesic dome while somebody explains how to manifest aligned consciousness, to watch frat boys
						swinging from
						trapezes
						while removing their own shorts, and to chase sharks across the desert in a whaling ship.</p>
					<p>Participation is our number one value. We don't have spectators, tourists, or sparkle-ponies.
						We don't pay people to build our camp for us. Everyone helps build and strike the camp.
						Everyone can expect to do shifts preparing meals, cleaning up, fetching ice, whatever needs
						to be done.

							<h3>Our first year</h3>
							<ul class="meta">
								<li>By Jetpack Joel</li>
							</ul>
							<p>In 2018, I went with sixteen friends to Burning Man for the first time.
								None of us had been before. We called our camp GTM - the Gay
								Turtle Makeout. I had some idea of what to expect from videos,
								pictures, and descriptions on the Internet, but the minute I arrived
								I was completely blown away.
							</p>
							<p>The first time I realized that there was something <em>extra</em> going on
								was on my very first bike ride, travelling across the city on the bike
								I had borrowed for the week, and I noticed that,
								despite the dust and dirt, I was actually in the cleanest city I had ever
								been to in the world. There was literally not a single piece of garbage to be
								seen. If you've ever been to a music festival and waded knee-deep in litter
								you might think that this kind of urban cleanliness is not something that the human
								race is capable of pulling off.
							</p>
							<p>The next weird thing was that I literally did not see a single item that I
								might have recognized from a normal city. There were no banks, shops, crazy people,
								Starbucks, 7-11s, or traffic. Instead there was art, fabulous mutant vehicles,
								tent villages, and parades of beautiful people of all ages in every imaginable form
								of dress.
							</p>
							<p>And then I noticed that everyone was extremely friendly and was delighted to
								engage me in conversation. The operating system of this city was different than
								anything I had ever encountered before: more like a picnic with friends, but
								with 70,000 friends.
							</p>
							<p>By the end of the day, my mind was fully blown. I had had several amazing experiences
								that were literally beyond the realm of anything I thought an amazing experience could
								be.
								On a scale of, say, 1-100, I kept having experiences that were well above 300 and made
								me feel that my personal "how awesome is this?" scale was broken and I had just never
								encountered anything like this before.
							</p>
							<p>And finally, I just had to think to myself, "holy shit, this is the future." Black Rock
								City,
								a temporary city in the desert, is actually a giant, collaborative artwork created by
								70,000
								people every single year. It is an artwork in the form of a civilization that is unique
								to the world, and, as such, it is the largest single collaborative work of art in the
								history of the human
								race.
							</p>

							<h3>The Future Turtles</h3>
							<p>That camp of 16 friends came back the next year as The Gay Turtles.
								This time, though, we knew a lot more about what we were doing and had better shade,
								better logistics, some gifts for our neighbors,
								and all around a better idea of how to survive the week in the Black Rock Desert. We
								introduced the idea of a high intensity workout in the desert which proved to be
								popular.
							</p>
							<p>
								In 2020 and 2021, the "official" Burning Man did not happen due to the global pandemic
								(although there was an amazing renegade burn in 2021).</p>
							<p>The Turtles finally returned to
								Black Rock City in force in 2022, with 36 awesome members. We did everything bigger and
								better
								than before. You can read a complete report of our previous burns
								here: <a href="/2022/report.html">2022</a> <a href="/2023/report.html">2023</a> <a
									href="/2024/report.html">2024</a>
